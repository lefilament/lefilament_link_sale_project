=================
Le Filament Link Sale to Project
=================

This module provides a new functionality to transform your sale order in projects and tasks (and to update those in case sale order is updated)

Product template has been enhanced, invoicing policy section in order to set how each product should behave when transformed from sale order to project/task.

This module depends upon *sale_service* and *lefilament_projets* modules.


Configuration
=====

1. In *Sales > Products* when creating a product of Service type, in *Invoicing > Invoicing policy* you can now use an extra *track service* named 'Create a project and link tasks'.


  > Note : the existing *track services* are preserved and can still be used together with the following options, the new service was created in order not to track hours as delivered in sale order. As a remainder for the existing types:

  > - Manual : delivered quantities are manually set on sale order line

  > - Timesheet : hours spent on project with the same customer are reported in the sale order as delivered quantities

  > - Task : Create a task in a specific project (if filled) and reports hours from this task in delivered quantities
  

Now you can add project and task type for this product.

- If you select none, when creating a project from sale order, a wizard will propose you to select an existing project or to create a new one and a task will be created inside that project with the content of your sale order line description.

- If you select a project and a task type, when creating a project from sale order, a new task with the content of the sale order line description will be created inside the defined project with defined task type.


2. In *Sales > Configuration > Settings* you can now configure the default task type / stage you want to use when creating task associated to a sale order line.

3. In *Project > Configuration > Stages* a new boolean field case_default / Default step has been added to each stage to define which stages should be added by default to any new project.

4. In *Project > Configuration > Configuration* an *alias prefix* has been added so that new projects will have an e-mail alias prefixed with this field


Usage
=====

1. Configure your Odoo instance as described in previous section

2. On each confirmed sale order you find a new button to *Create Project* that will open a wizard to select existing project or creating a new one. Tasks would be assigned to selected project, with associated scheduled time (depending on sale price / daily cost configured in Project configuration)

3. You can also follow the various tasks and timesheets associated to that sale order 

4. On sale order line update, click on button *Update tasks* to update projects and tasks associated with this sale order.
